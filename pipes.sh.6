.TP
.B -c [0-(COLORS-1)]
Color index of pipes. Multiple arguments can be used. (default is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
0)

\fICOLORS\fR is the available colors depending on \fB$TERM\fR capability.  For
examples, \fBxterm\fR has 8 colors, \fBxterm-256color\fR has 256 colors, and
\fBxterm-direct\fR -- requires ncurses 6.1+ -- has 16,777,216 colors.

The color index is used to generate escape code using \fBtput setaf
color_index\fR.

For 256 colors, you may use 0 to 255 as color index.  For 16,777,216 colors,
the index can be calculated with three color components,  R * 65536 + G * 256 +
B (0 <= R, G, B < 256).

You can also use hexadecimal, for examples:
.RS 8
.TP 12
-c\fB#ffff\fR
# cyan color
.TP
-c\fB#FFA500\fR
# orange color
.TP
-c\fB#64\fR
# for 256color index 100

.SH HISTORY
\fIpipes.sh\fR was originally created by Matthew Simpson and posted to the
.UR https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=728932#p728932
Arch Linux Forums
.UE
in early 2010. It was also later posted to
.UR https://gist.github.com/msimpson/1096939
Gist
.UE
released in the public domain.

In early 2013, Yu-Jie Lin posted a modification of the script to Gist after
reading about it on a
.UR https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/pipes-sh-a-little-bit-of-fun/
blog
.UE .
It was maintained on Gist independently for a period of a few months.

In 2014, the script was given its own GitHub repository as a project which
encouraged contributions from other developers. As the project gained more
popularity the decision was made to combine forces with developers of similar
projects.

Finally in 2015, the MIT License was added and the Pipeseroni collective was
formed (see \fBLINKS\fR below) to maintain the project.
