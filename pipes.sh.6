.SH HISTORY
\fIpipes.sh\fR was originally created by Matthew Simpson and posted to the
.UR https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=728932#p728932
Arch Linux Forums
.UE
in early 2010. It was also later posted to
.UR https://gist.github.com/msimpson/1096939
Gist
.UE
released in the public domain.

In early 2013, Yu-Jie Lin posted a modification of the script to Gist after
reading about it on a
.UR https://inconsolation.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/pipes-sh-a-little-bit-of-fun/
blog
.UE .
It was maintained on Gist independently for a period of a few months.

In 2014, the script was given its own GitHub repository as a project which
encouraged contributions from other developers. As the project gained more
popularity the decision was made to combine forces with developers of similar
projects.

Finally in 2015, the MIT License was added and the Pipeseroni collective was
formed (see \fBLINKS\fR below) to maintain the project.
