    Benchmarking pipes.sh by revisions excluding terminal render time
    
    Usage:

        $ scripts/benchmark.sh <revision>...

    Method:

        This script uses Bash keyword time to measure the execution time t of 
        pipes.sh for certain amount of pipe characters -- through -r LIMIT -- 
        which is 1000 by default.

        Without modifications, pipes.sh runs forever with timing control, 
        therefore mkp_pipes() monkey-patches pipes.sh in order to

        * make read builtin as nop using : builtin

          We do not want the delay which is one of two purpose of using read, 
          we want pipes.sh to pipe out the pipe as fast as it can.

        * exit and cleanup when reach -r LIMIT characters

        * have a (logical) terminal size 80x24

        The time returns a real time (%R) t, which is used to calculate with 
        LIMIT for a performance index, pipe chars per second:

            cps = LIMIT / t

        cps is calculated by bc program since Bash can not handle float 
        numbers.

    Environment variables:

        LIMIT

            Used for pipes.sh option -r LIMIT.

        TIMEF

            The timing helper function, whose value can be one of:

            * time_ndis (default)

                Do not time terminal render time by sending pipes to /dev/null

            * time_disp

                Time terminal render time

    Important notes:

        * It benchmarks with default options of each revision's pipes.sh
        
        * It excludes terminal render time

        It's impossible to enforce the options as development goes, and the 
        whole purpose of benchmarking is to have a (at least) comparable 
        performance index that we can compare as we attempt to improve and 
        optimize the code.

        If without the latter, that is not excluding the terminal render time, 
        the index would be clouded and even distorted, because you can't
        actually guarantee

        a) the improvement works for another terminal (emulator) in part of 
           render.  This also means whatever you do to the code, it might have 
           opposite effect in another terminal in term of execution time; and

        b) the render in terminal may have or haven't been optimized that could 
           affect the speed of render, which might also based on what and how 
           data the terminal receives.

        c) consistence of each run.  When render in X Window, there are more 
           coming into affecting the performance.  With each component 
           inevitably layered up -- not just terminal (emulator) and X Window 
           System, e.g.  there is also font system -- each could vary the 
           execution time, in turn, the level of variation increases.

        In other words, with render part, the results of revisions are less 
        comparable, which defeats the purpose of having a benchmark, therefore 
        this benchmark script (so should the improvement) only focuses on the 
        internal part, and excluding the terminal render time.

    Other notes:

        * pipes.sh revision references:

            * ''  (empty string): index (staged)
            * '.' (single dot)  : working directory
