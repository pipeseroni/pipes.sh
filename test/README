Running tests
=============

    $ make test          # shortcut for the next
    $ test/run_tests.sh  # or
    $ test/test_*.sh     # individually


Checklist
=========

* Variables for tests:

  * Must declare them using local.  (test cases only)

  * Prefix an underscore.

* If adding new default settings, please add new checks to the default settings 
  test in test/test_parse.sh, ensuring no default settings can be changed 
  without failing the test.


Notes
=====

RANDOM
------

Bash RANDOM is used in pipes.sh, even it's not heavily, it will interfere the 
tests as its purpose is to provide a random number.  In order to test a piece 
of code that uses RANDOM, deterministically, we need to use a mock for RANDOM 
for a deterministic sequences of numbers of our choices.

In test_helper.bash, _RND_* and _CP provides the mock.  Basically you wrap the 
code with two special comments, _CP extracts the code and make it as a 
function and replace RANDOM with the mock to be used by eval.

You then supply the random numbers you want using _RND_push, and the RANDOM 
will be expanded to that exact sequence in the newly extracted function 
execution.

Please read the comments of the two components in test_helper.bash for more 
details.
