Contributing Guideline
======================

Any contributions are greatly appreciated, whether it's codes or documenting,
or helping out on issues.

However, in order to reduce unnecessary works and communications, please make
sure you read this guideline before carrying out any tasks.


Pull Requests
=============

Please follow the general rules below:

* Release your changes under the MIT License.
* Keep your PR and commit atomic: *One PR, One Commit, One Issue*.

  * You may be asked to fix something, just add a commit for the changes, we
    will squash the commits, another reason to keep your PR atomic.

* Title your PR appropriately.
* Write a concise commit summary and a detailed message body.
* Comment your changes adequately.
* Update the following files as needed:

  * ``README.rst``
  * ``pipes.sh.6``

* When in doubt, ask in issues first, a few examples:

  * If it could be a big commit, which is impossible to split.
  * Changing default settings or existing behaviors.
